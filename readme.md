A Chrome extension which converts "special fonts" that are made of Unicode characters into their ASCII letter equivalent.
This project is meant to assist people who rely on screen readers, as well as those whose computers cannot handle special Unicode characters.

Current status:

 When a button is clicked in the extension icon, any characters in the following lists contained within a tweet will be converted to plain text.

Character lists:
- "Small Caps"

Character list TODOs:
- Emojis
-  Everything listed on this page: http://qaz.wtf/u/convert.cgi

Functionality TODOs:

- Alter UI to make it automatic instead of requiring a button press
- Handle dynamic loading of new tweets as they happen
- Handle single tweets, replies, notifications
- Handle usernames
- Translate ASCII art into text describing the image

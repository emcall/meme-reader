A Chrome extension which converts "special fonts" that are made of Unicode characters into their ASCII letter equivalent.
This project is meant to assist people who rely on screen readers, as well as those whose computers cannot handle special Unicode characters.

Current status:

 When a button is clicked in the extension icon, any characters in the following lists contained within a tweet will be converted to plain text.

Character lists:
- "Small Caps"

Character list TODOs:
- Everything listed on this page: http://qaz.wtf/u/convert.cgi
- Emojis
- Zalgo

Functionality TODOs:
- Handle dynamic loading of new tweets as they happen
- Handle single tweets, replies, notifications
- Handle usernames

UI Options TODOs:
- Allow user to choose if the script runs automatically on page load, is triggered by a button press, or triggered by a key press
- Toggle options for translating each individual font set
- Ability to add additional fonts for translation

Stretch Goal:
- Translate ASCII memes (such as "in this house", "bunny holding sign", "cup of tea") into a message describing the meme
